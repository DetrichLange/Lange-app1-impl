User guide:

This to-do list application is capable of storing more than 100 items with a description, due date, and completion
status. It can save to or load from a txt file in a location of the user's choice, and all parameters can be edited.

The button at the top left will create a new to-do item. Initially this item will show "no description", no date, and
will not be marked as complete. Clicking multiple times will create multiple items. All items created this way will be
initially visible.

The button immediately to the right of the new item button will clear the list, removing all items.

The hide/show complete and hide/show incomplete buttons both work similarly. Pressing one of those buttons will cause
all items in the current list which are complete or incomplete, respectively, to become invisible. Pressing it again
will cause the invisible items to return. Items that are invisible are still present and will be exported.

To edit the description of an entry, simply type whatever text you want into the text box, up to 256 characters. Any
length in excess of 256 characters will be truncated. After typing in your description, press Save Item, or the changes
will not be saved.

To give a due date to an entry or change the due date it has, click the calendar field below the description field.
You can select any valid date. After selecting or changing a date, press Save Item, or the changes will not be saved.

To mark an item as complete or incomplete, use the check box below the item description field. A checked item is 
considered to be completed, an unchecked item is incomplete. After changing the completion status of an entry, press
Save Item.

The Delete Item button next to each entry will delete that entry only.

The Export button at the bottom left will open a file explorer window. Select a txt file, and the contents of that file
will be overwritten with the to-do list.

The Import button to the right of the Export button will also open a file explorer window. Select a file which was
created by the export function of this application, and it will replace any current entries in the application window
with the entries saved in that text file.
